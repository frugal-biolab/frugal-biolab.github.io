## How to contribute

Here goes information on how to step-by-step add a new markdown file to protocols and make a pull request. This can be done without CLI.

1. Open the `protocols` folder in the repository
   ![readme_1](https://github.com/frugal-biolab/frugal-biolab.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/readme_1.png?raw=true)

2. Inside the `Add file` menu, click `Create new file`

3. Give your protocol a file name - make sure it's not used by other protocols. Make sure the file name is short and concise. Don't forget to add a `.md` extension - our protocols are written in Markdown.

4.  Write your protocol using this template:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Protocol Title
   author: Your Name
   affiliation: Your university or company
   
   layout: page
   ---
   
   Motivation for doing the procedure[^footnote1]
   
   ## Supplies
   - Supply 1
   - Supply 2
   
   ## Procedure
   1. Step 1
   2. Step 2
   
   ## Validated Equipment
   Supply 1:
   - Product 1
   - Product 2
   
   Supply 2:
   - Product 1
   - Product 2
   
   ## Notes
   [^footnote1]: Footnote 1 explanation
   ```

   Keep in mind that this is only a template, and you can edit all these variables to your linking!

5. Make sure your protocol looks good using "Preview" tab - the table that appears at the top will not be displayed on the website, and is needed to sort protocol correctly.

6. Under `Propose new file` write `Add protocol: Protocol Name` (use actual protocol name) and press `Propose new file`
   ![readme_5](https://github.com/frugal-biolab/frugal-biolab.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/readme_5.png?raw=true)

7. Your protocol is ready! Press `Create pull request` !
   ![readme_6](https://github.com/frugal-biolab/frugal-biolab.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/readme_6.png?raw=true)

8. In pull request name write `Add protocol: Protocol Name` and leave the comments you'd like to leave - maybe something is not displaying correctly, or you are wondering if this protocol has been validated on other equipment. After that, click `Create pull request`
   ![readme_7](https://github.com/frugal-biolab/frugal-biolab.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/readme_7.png?raw=true)

9. Your pull request is now open! Wait for us to review your protocol, and if we have comments or concerns, we will let you know, and guide you through the process of editing your contribution.
   ![readme_8](https://github.com/frugal-biolab/frugal-biolab.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/readme_8.png?raw=true)

10. When your protocol is accepted, its status will change to "Merged", and you will get an email notification! Your protocol is now live on the Frugal Biolab website!
